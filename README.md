# Suspense Demo for Library Authors

I made this demo to complement [Suspense for Data Fetching](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html) and [Concurrent UI Patterns](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.html) documentation. **It is highly experimental and primarily aimed at library authors!**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
